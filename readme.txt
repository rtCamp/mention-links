This plugin lets you mention a user or a post (including Custom Post Types) in post content from the block editor. Type `@` to link to an author or `#` to link to a post, page, or custom post type.

== Description ==

While writing contents from the block editor, type `@` to get suggestions of users. On selecting a user it will create a link to authors page of that user.  
To mention a post, type `#` and it will give you the list of all matching posts. On selecting a post it will create a link to the single post page.

= Settings =
This plugins adds a settings page under **Settings -> Mention Links**.

1. **Display username or display-name:** This setting allows you choose whether to show user's display-name or username when mentioning a user in a post.
2. **Custom Post Types support:** Checking post types here will give you suggestions of posts from these post types.

**Note:** The posts suggestion list is retrieved from the WordPress REST API, so if a particular post type doesn't support REST API then you might not see it in **Custom Post Types support** setting.
